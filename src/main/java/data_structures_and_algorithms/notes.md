# Graphs

## Terms

- Nodes or vertices
- Edges
- Direction
- Weight
- Degree

### Undirected Graph

- A graph in which edges do not have any direction. That is the nodes are unordered pairs in the definition of every
  edge.

### Directed Graph

- A graph in which edge has direction. That is the nodes are ordered pairs in the definition of every edge.

### Connected Graph

- The graph in which from one node we can visit any other node in the graph is known as a connected graph.

### Disconnected Graph

- The graph in which at least one node is not reachable from a node is known as a disconnected graph.

### Regular Graph

- The graph in which the degree of every vertex is equal to K is called K regular graph.

### Complete Graph

- The graph in which from each node there is an edge to each other node.

### Cycle Graph

- The graph in which the graph is a cycle in itself, the minimum value of degree of each vertex is 2.

### Cyclic Graph

- A graph containing at least one cycle is known as a Cyclic graph.

### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

- A Directed Graph that does not contain any cycle.

### Bipartite Graph

- A graph in which vertex can be divided into two sets such that vertex in each set does not contain any edge between
  them.

### Weighted Graph

- A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight is known as a weighted graph.

## Representation

- Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List

## Traversal

- BFS - Queue
- DFS - Stack

# Tree

### Spanning Tree

- A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, such that all the vertices are connected using minimum possible number of
  edges.

### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

- A minimum spanning tree (MST) is defined as a spanning tree that has the minimum weight among all the possible
  spanning trees.
